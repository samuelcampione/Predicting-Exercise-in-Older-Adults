# Daily Physical Activity and Personality Factors in Older Adults

<br>

This is a project I've been working on in my lab for a paper. The main idea is looking at the effect of personality factors on daily engagement in physical activity. The data comes from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) national longitudinal survey, which contains a daily diary study. Please read the [abstract](https://github.com/stcampione/Physical-Activity-Personality/blob/main/abstract.md) from the paper.

This is still a work in progress and will be updated. 

<br>

For now, the [SAS script](https://github.com/stcampione/Physical-Activity-Personality/blob/main/bring%20in%20data%20MIDUS%20refresher.sas) is for a random effects logistic regression model looking at whether or not someone engaged in physical activity. I am currently working on the code for the full two-part mixed effects model. Additionally, I checked the personality trait scale score by writing my [own SAS code](https://github.com/stcampione/Physical-Activity-Personality/blob/main/hand_calculate_scale_scores_M1%20(1).sas) to calculate scordes and comparing results 

<br>

Also included is the R script I used to check for statisticallly significant differences in the MIDUS samples ([R Script](https://github.com/stcampione/Physical-Activity-Personality/blob/main/M1%20MRef%20compare%20samples.R)).


# Abstract
"Physical inactivity in older adults is linked to negative health outcomes and an increased risk of premature death. Previous findings have evidenced personality as a correlate of physical activity. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between personality and daily engagement in physical activity for older adults. Participants come from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study consisting of multiple waves of data collection across several decades. The sample studied here includes distinct samples of retired older adults from MIDUS 1 and the MIDUS Refresher studies. Participants of both studies completed a comprehensive telephone interview and self-administered questionnaires, followed by daily interviews for 8 consecutive days. Results did not indicate personality as a significant predictor of daily likeliness of engaging in physical activity. Results did show that Openness as a predictor of increased/decreased individual differences in daily likeliness of engaging in physical activity. The findings of this study implicate the importance and benefit of using daily diary methods to obtain more accurate and precise data and to explore unique aspects of behavior. Specifically, repeated measures allow for novel insight into the individual differences in variability of a behavior."

# Physical-Activity-Personality 

<br>

This is a project I've been working on in my lab for a paper. The main idea is looking at the effect of personality factors on daily engagement in physical activity. The data comes from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) national longitudinal survey, which contains a daily diary study.

This is still a work in progress and will be updated as it progresses.

For now, the SAS code is for a random effects logistic regression model looking at whether or not someone engaged in physical activity. I am currently working on the code for the full two-part mixed effects model.
